# JB-HiFi-Weather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Key Features in the solution
* React app located in the ClientApp folder - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* WebApi available to service the front-end React app. The WebApi have a REST URL that accepts both a city name and country name.
* Rate Limition - 5 requests per hour maximum limit - client id or can support ip address.
* Integration with Open Weather API and providing weather description of the specified city and country.

### Running the solution

Follow these steps:

* Install Visual Studio 2022.
* Install NodeJs.
* Clone the repo.
* Restore All new packages in Visual Studio.
* Make sure that the web project is the start-up project.
* Click Run to start the app.

### Running Unit Test - React - Command Line Interface

When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.

The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:

### Running Unit Test - Back End

When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.

By default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.

Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.

Jest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.
